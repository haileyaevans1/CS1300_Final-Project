Our festive website is the perfect place to make the holiday season extra special. 
The homepage features an interactive Christmas Day countdown, 
letting you track the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the special day arrives. 
In the recipes page, you’ll find a curated collection of delicious Christmas sweets and drink recipes, 
perfect for baking and having some fun. 
From sugar cookies to hot chocolate, there’s something to satisfy every sweet tooth and warm you up on cold winter nights!
Each food item includes a recipe that's easy to follow along.

In addition to recipes, our website offers a list of traditional Christmas movies, 
ensuring that you can enjoy the holiday spirit whether you're curled up with family or hosting a movie marathon with friends. 
To round out your holiday experience, our website suggests festive activities such as ice skating and going to look at Christmas lights,
helping you make the most of the season!
Whether you’re looking for ideas to keep the kids entertained, create lasting memories, or just fill your life with Christmas cheer,
our site is packed with inspiration to ensure that your holiday season is merry and bright!

To get into more detail of the technical side, the homepage has a twinkling animation on the countdown to create a fun effect.
We made this happen by using the twinkle animation via keyframes in our CSS stylesheet.
In the recipes page, each button that displays the recipe of that item was produced by an API
that holds a bunch of recipes and displays it in a dropdown menu.
In the movies page, each movie box has a details button that displays another box that has the plot, the title and the year, and the cast of that movie.
We accomplished this by using an API that takes data from a movie website and we told it specific things we wanted displayed.
In the activities page, the images are being grabbed from an API where you can upload your own photos. 
We used a fetch function to grab the images and be able to store and use them,
even with future projects!
For the recipe and movie pages, we used flex-box to make it the perfect shape of the boxes. 
In the activities page, we used a Javascript and CSS function that puts the images in an interactive slideshow.
